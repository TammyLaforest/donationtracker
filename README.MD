    # Documentation of Easy Donor - Tammy Laforest - CS50 Fall 2018

    I made a trello for the project. The first column has links to all of the files associated with this project. https://trello.com/b/i8mKALZ5/easy-donor-build

    I have been running this program through my localhost in a virtualenv.
    Virtualenvwrapper, virtualenv, with python 3 and pip3.

    This is a link to a google drive folder that now contains my .bashrc and .bash_profile files which seemed to be of great importance for this. They were in my home folder.

    It also includes the pipfile and requirements.txt from which you can install all of the requirements very quickly.

    I built the project in my mac terminal with Atom as my editor. While I tried many, many different things that you will see evidence of in my git commits, ultimately I gave up trying to use Heroku and MySql in order to save time. I consider this project to still be in the very early stages, and will move into something better when I am further along.

    It is a Django based project. Currently the project uses Sqlite.  Database file linked here. You can use that to test the project. I broke something in the new user creation today, but hopefully I get it back up and running within the next couple of hours.

    >Test User:
    >Username: Tammy
    >Password: Password123!

    Because I was brand new at Django and only an infant in Python, it took me a while to figure out how to make things visible, but I was able to build logical models and get most of the functionality I was going for in the django admin section. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

    I suggest git cloning the project to see how it works. It is kind of huge though. Though that is largely because I have bootstrap.css and bootstrap.js directly in it. If youâ€™d like me to push the project with those removed, I can do that, but for now I will leave them in there because I am afraid to break it.
