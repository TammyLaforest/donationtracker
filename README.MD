Build with the following:

I have been running this program through my localhost in a virtualenv.
Virtualenvwrapper, virtualenv.  How to install Virtuaenv.

I made a Trello board for the project. The first column has links to all of the files associated with this project. https://trello.com/b/i8mKALZ5/easy-donor-build

This document as a google doc with active links: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ae_KIi0f3vdXUV8XyLHeUHF3DOzDj8U6ESPPhAy1C2w/

This is a link to a google drive folder that now contains my .bashrc and .bash_profile files which seemed to be of great importance for this. They were in my home folder. :

It also includes the pipfile and requirements.txt from which you can install all of the requirements very quickly.

I built the project in my mac terminal with Atom as my editor. It is a Django, Python project. Currently the project uses Sqlite.  Database file linked in folder.
You can use that to test the project. I broke something in the new user creation today, but hopefully I get it back up and running within the next couple of hours.

Because I was brand new at Django and only an infant in Python, it took me a while to figure out how to make things visible, but I was able to build logical models and get most of the functionality I was going for in the django admin section. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

I suggest git cloning the project to see how it works. It is kind of huge though. Though that is largely because I have bootstrap.css and bootstrap.js directly in it. If youâ€™d like me to push the project with those removed, I can do that, but for now I will leave them in there because I am afraid to break it.
